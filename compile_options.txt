-DKILL_GDB

        [kill gdb to restore it],
        on windows to prevent from this one must use
            -DWIN_CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE_FOR_GDB
    ]
    [note: 
        on windows to use this option, you must use
            -DWIN_CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE_FOR_GDB option.
    ]
    kill gdb after returning from "fall to gdb" option.
    as effect, for example, "continue" command will close gdb.
    
-WIN_RUN_GDB_IN_ERROR_HANDLER
    [windows only]
    no, debuger will be run always, but if this option is set,
    debugger will be called inside SEH handler, and to see real 
    exception you must use "continue" command.
    This option can be used, if gdb is not running, 
    [but this is unusual behaviour, and bug]
